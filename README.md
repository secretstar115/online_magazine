Magazine Website 
=====

This simple online magazine website was developed for a project assignment. Uses PHP and jquery. Features a simple login and administration system for creating and reviewing articles, among other things. Everything is very well documented, so can be useful to someone wanting to get into these topics. The project was completed under a deadline, hence it's not complete and is meant to be used for educational purposes only. 

Everything on the back-end was developed from scrath with the Model View Controller pattern.
